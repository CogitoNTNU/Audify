Ah ‚Äî getting **static** instead of intelligible speech is a very common symptom in voice conversion pipelines, and it usually points to **problems in one or more of these areas**:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Vocoder / Mel-to-Waveform Step

* You‚Äôre currently using **`InverseMelScale + Griffin-Lim`**.
* Griffin-Lim is an **iterative algorithm**, but it‚Äôs very sensitive to:

  * The **number of iterations** (default in PyTorch may be too low).
  * The **mel spectrogram scaling** ‚Äî log-mels vs. linear-mels.
* If the input to Griffin-Lim isn‚Äôt scaled correctly, you can get **static or noisy audio**.

**Likely culprit:** This is the most common reason for static at the end of your pipeline. Neural vocoders like **HiFi-GAN** usually solve this problem entirely.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Decoder Output

* Your **dummy Transformer decoder** is not trained.
* Right now it‚Äôs just projecting latent + speaker embeddings through random weights.
* The output mel spectrogram is **essentially random** ‚Üí feeding that into any vocoder produces noise/static.

**Key point:** Until your decoder is **trained on paired data** (source mel ‚Üí target mel), you will never get intelligible voice.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Latent Content or Speaker Embedding Issues

* If the latent content (`preprocessed mel`) is incorrectly extracted or normalized, the decoder input may be nonsensical.
* Similarly, if the speaker embedding is wrong (e.g., extremely small or large values), concatenating it can corrupt the input.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing / Mel Parameters

* Check that **`n_mels`, `hop_length`, and `n_fft`** match across:

  * Preprocessing (`preprocess.py`)
  * Decoder (`decoder.py`)
  * Vocoder (`mel_to_waveform` / future HiFi-GAN)
* Mismatched parameters lead to **wrong spectrogram shapes**, which can produce noise.

### ‚úÖ In Summary

The **main reason you hear static is twofold**:

1. **Decoder is untrained**, so the "converted mel" is essentially random.
2. **Griffin-Lim vocoder** is very sensitive, especially with log-mels and small iteration counts.

### üîπ Suggested Next Steps

1. Switch to a **pretrained neural vocoder** like **HiFi-GAN** ‚Äî this will instantly improve audio quality.
2. Train your **decoder** properly with a dataset of source ‚Üí target mels. Right now the output is just random.
3. Make sure **mel preprocessing parameters match** across the entire pipeline.

If you want, I can **rewrite your decoder + vocoder section** using **HiFi-GAN**, so you can at least hear something intelligible even before training.

Do you want me to do that?
