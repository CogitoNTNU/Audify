Perfect 👌 — let’s build you a **step-by-step training plan for the speaker encoder** (the voice cloning part). This will let you deliver a model that takes in 5–10 s of speech and outputs a clean **speaker embedding vector** that your colleagues can plug into their TTS system.

---

# 🔹 Step-by-Step Training Plan: Speaker Encoder

---

## 1. Pick a Dataset

Your encoder only needs **speaker-labeled audio**, not transcripts.

* **Recommended**:

  * **VoxCeleb1 + VoxCeleb2** (~7000 speakers, hundreds of hours)
  * **LibriSpeech train-other-500** (500 hours, many speakers)
  * **VCTK** (smaller, 109 speakers, studio-quality)

👉 For best results, start with **VoxCeleb2**.

---

## 2. Preprocess Audio

Consistency is critical.

* **Resample**: choose a single rate (16 kHz or 22.05 kHz; many use 16 kHz for speaker models).
* **Mono only**: downmix stereo.
* **Trim silence**: use energy-based VAD or librosa’s `effects.trim`.
* **Normalize loudness**: RMS/LUFS normalization.
* **Extract mels**:

Example config (matches many published encoders):

```python
sampling_rate = 16000
n_fft = 512
hop_length = 160   # 10 ms
win_length = 400   # 25 ms
n_mels = 40
fmin, fmax = 0, 8000
```

---

## 3. Model Architecture

Common design (from **GE2E paper** / Real-Time-Voice-Cloning):

* **Input**: (batch_size, time, mel_bins)
* **Stack of 3-5 LSTM/GRU layers** (hidden size ~256–768)
* **Projection layer** → 256-dim vector
* **L2 normalize** output

Pseudocode:

```python
class SpeakerEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_mels=40, hidden=768, emb_dim=256):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(n_mels, hidden, num_layers=3, batch_first=True)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden, emb_dim)

    def forward(self, mel_batch):
        # mel_batch: (B, T, n_mels)
        outputs, _ = self.lstm(mel_batch)
        # take last frame or mean-pool
        pooled = outputs.mean(dim=1)
        emb = self.linear(pooled)
        emb = F.normalize(emb, p=2, dim=1)  # L2 norm
        return emb  # (B, emb_dim)
```

---

## 4. Training Objective — GE2E Loss

**GE2E (Generalized End-to-End) loss** encourages embeddings from the same speaker to be close, and different speakers to be far apart.

Batch construction:

* Pick **N speakers** per batch.
* Pick **M utterances** per speaker.
* Compute embeddings → speaker centroids (exclude current utterance when scoring).
* Compute cosine similarity matrix → GE2E loss.

👉 There are PyTorch implementations you can borrow (e.g. from [Real-Time-Voice-Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning)).

---

## 5. Training Loop

Pseudo-workflow:

```python
for batch in dataloader:
    # batch: (N*M, T, n_mels), speaker_ids: (N*M)
    embeddings = encoder(mels)  # (N*M, 256)
    loss = ge2e_loss(embeddings, speaker_ids)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

Hyperparameters (starting point):

* Optimizer: Adam, lr=1e-3 → 1e-4 with decay.
* Batch: N=64 speakers × M=10 utterances = 640 samples.
* Training time: hundreds of thousands of steps.

---

## 6. Validation & Evaluation

Metrics:

* **Speaker Verification EER** (Equal Error Rate): pair utterances, compute cosine similarity, threshold to classify “same/different speaker.” Lower EER = better.
* **Embedding visualization**: t-SNE/UMAP to check if speakers cluster.

---

## 7. Packaging for Inference

You want a clean API your colleagues can consume:

```python
def preprocess_wav(path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    # load wav, resample, trim, normalize
    # return np.array [T]
    
def wav_to_embedding(path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    wav = preprocess_wav(path)
    mel = wav_to_mel(wav)              # shape (T, n_mels)
    emb = encoder(torch.tensor(mel).unsqueeze(0))
    return emb.squeeze().cpu().numpy()  # shape (256,)
```

Output: **256-D float32 numpy array**, L2-normalized.

This is what you pass to the TTS group.

---

## 8. Integration Tips

* **Agree on mel parameters** with the TTS team.
* **Agree on embedding size & normalization** (usually 256-D, L2-normalized).
* Provide sample embeddings + test script so they can plug in easily.

---

## 9. Optional Improvements

* Try **ResNet-based encoders** (ResNet34/Res2Net + pooling) — often outperform pure LSTM.
* Add **speaker adversarial losses** if needed.
* Train on **larger/cleaner corpora** for robustness.

---

✅ **Summary of Output**:
After training, your encoder produces a **speaker embedding** from a short voice sample. Downstream, the TTS model will use this embedding to generate speech that sounds like the target speaker, given arbitrary text.

Would you like me to **draft a skeleton PyTorch training script** (with GE2E loss and dataloader setup), so you can actually start experimenting with VoxCeleb?
